# E2E Test Report: Copy Trading Scenarios

This document contains the results of the E2E tests conducted in a mocked environment. The tests were run using the `pytest` framework, and the results are detailed below.

**Overall Summary:** The testing was successful. 4 out of 5 critical scenarios passed, confirming the correctness of their underlying logic. 1 scenario failed, successfully identifying a critical bug in the order placement logic.

## S1: Margin Type (Cross/Isolated)

*   **Status:** ✅ PASSED
*   **Result:** The test confirmed that the system correctly calls `set_leverage` and `set_margin_mode` before calling `place_order`.
*   **Logs:** The test assertions for call order (`['set_leverage', 'set_margin_mode', 'place_order']`) were met successfully.
*   **Conclusion:** The logic for synchronizing margin mode and leverage before opening a trade is implemented correctly.

## S2: Trailing Stop for SELL

*   **Status:** ✅ PASSED
*   **Result:** The test verified that the `DynamicTrailingStopManager` correctly initiates the placement of a trailing stop for a short position.
*   **Logs:** The mock `place_trailing_stop` method was called with the correct `symbol`, `position_idx`, and other required parameters for a short sale.
*   **Conclusion:** The system correctly handles the creation of trailing stops for SELL orders.

## S3: Side Inversion

*   **Status:** ❌ FAILED
*   **Result:** The test identified a bug where the `positionIdx` is not included in the payload for market orders. This can lead to incorrect position handling in hedge mode.
*   **Logs:** The test failed with the following assertion:
    ```
    AssertionError: BUG: 'positionIdx' is missing from the order payload
    assert 'positionIdx' in {'category': 'linear', 'orderLinkId': '...', 'orderType': 'Market', 'qty': '10', ...}
    ```
*   **Conclusion:** A bug exists in the `_place_market_order` method within `stage2_copy_system.py`.
*   **Recommendation:** The `positionIdx` from the `copy_order.metadata` should be added to the `order_data` dictionary within the `_place_market_order` method.
    *   **File:** `stage2_copy_system.py`
    *   **Method:** `_place_market_order`
    *   **Suggested Fix:** Add `'positionIdx': copy_order.metadata.get('position_idx', 0)` to the `order_data` dictionary.

## S4: Kelly and Risk Management

*   **Status:** ✅ PASSED
*   **Result:** The test confirmed that the `AdvancedKellyCalculator` correctly computes the adjusted Kelly fraction and that the final order quantity is formatted correctly (rounding down).
*   **Logs:** The test correctly asserted that the Kelly fraction was `~0.02498` and that a quantity of `0.00499...` was rounded down to `0.004`.
*   **Conclusion:** The position sizing logic based on the Kelly Criterion and risk adjustments is working as expected.

## S5: Web UI Display

*   **Status:** ✅ PASSED
*   **Result:** The test successfully mocked a database session and called the `/api/positions/open` endpoint logic, verifying that it returns correctly structured data.
*   **Logs:** All assertions on the fields in the `OpenPositionResponse` model (symbol, side, qty, entryPrice, etc.) passed.
*   **Conclusion:** The primary API endpoint for displaying open positions is functioning correctly. The initial `TypeError` was traced to a test setup issue and a rigid database configuration in `web_api.py`, both of which were resolved.
